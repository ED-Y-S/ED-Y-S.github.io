<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->



I am a first-year Ph.D student at the University of Chicago. My academic interests lie in Computer Security. In particular, I am interested in studying Anti-censorship Internet Measurement, Infrastructure Systems (such as IoT), and privacy-preserving adversarial methods to defend against privacy violation attacks from commercial Machine Learning (ML) models- <b>your information privacy right matters and you should be able to defend yourself</b>!

I am currently collaborating with Patrick Tser Jern Kon and Wyatt Ashley on a novel circumvention strategy, Nexus: utilizing packet-fragmenting algorithms against on-path attacks and billions of IoT networks to disrupt traffic surveillance from nation-state censors. [Check out our Poster](/papers/nexus_poster.pdf)!

If you'd like, also take a look at my [research statement](/personal_info/Research_Statement.pdf)!
